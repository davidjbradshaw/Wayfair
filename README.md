Please **feel free to open and read this straight away**. Take your time to think about it and plan. This can be some time right before you start coding, or even a day or two of thinking "in the background" - it's up to you.

# Introduction
## Objectives

The objective of this take-home exercise is:

- To let you show us how you structure your code into independent, reusable pieces, and also think about each piece in isolation.
- To set up ground for a live pair-programming exercise, including any follow up questions you might have for the product & design team to help tackle the problem below

## How to come across well

We value code that is readable, and conforms to good principles such as KISS/DRY/SOLID. We believe strongly in automated testing and we'd like to see evidence that you do too. We deliver our features in small incremental frequent releases rather than big-bang approach, and we'd like to see how you'd break the problem down into smaller deliverables.

We are interested in seeing how you:

- structure containers and components
- test a complex component’s logic (such as the navigation tree)
- use modern Javascript syntax and React hooks where necessary
- use CSS in JS
- manage internal and external state

## How will the interview work
This assessment is part of the technical evaluation, which consists of:
- The individual take-home assignment (you are doing this now)
- Sprint in a Day interview 
  - Product interview: during this interview, you'll work with the the product & design team to help tackle one of the remaining the problems
  - Technical interview: during this interview, you'll briefly explain your solution, and you'll drive a pair-programming session working on one of the remaining features 

## How to approach the assignment
- Please read the instructions, take some time to plan how you'll tackle this task
- You will have received this test as a .zip file – feel free to initialise a new private Github repository with this starter, and add us as collaborators when you’re ready for review. For the list of Github users to add, please ask your hiring manager. Alternatively, you can zip up your solution and send it back to us once you’re ready.
- Once you actually sit down to write code, please do not spend more than **1-2 hours of work**. Try to leave the code in good state - imagine you are going on a holiday and you need to hand over to a colleague. Whilst we won't time you, we _really_ mean you shouldn't spend an entire day coding this (thinking about it etc. is fine)
- We know the entire MVP is too much work for 1-2 hours. Part of the evaluation of this exercise is how you split a bigger deliverable into smaller tasks.
- Create a PR from the branch to master _within your private fork_ - this is super important. **Please do not raise PRs into our repo**. Send us a link to the PR in your private fork.
- During the interview, you'll briefly explain your solution, and you'll drive a pair-programming session working on one of the remaining features
- in a separate interview, we will discuss
  - how a real-world layout service could be implemented
  - what challenges we're likely to face, and how we could mitigate these

If at any point of this process you have any questions, please feel free to ask us via email.

# The Assignment

## Problem statement

Let's imagine we've decided to write a new layout for our Partner Home application. We're starting with an MVP that will:

- show a header that sticks to the top of the page when the page scrolls
- show a dropdown menu in the header, allowing the user to access Account Settings, etc
- show a two tier navigation menu on the left of the page. The menu itself can be expanded & collapsed per the designs
- populate the navigation by pulling in data from an API – an example JSON response is provided for you

You need to pick at minimum two of these features for the take-home part of the exercise. The designs for the concepts are included in the [\_designs/](_designs/) directory.

## Assumptions and important notes:

- You should go with the simplest solution that fulfills the MVP feature(s). We will evaluate code quality, readability, test coverage and correctness of implemented features. Correctness in a simple implementation beats unfinished complex one.

## External dependencies

At Wayfair, we use our own design system. At this stage we are unable to share this outside of the organisation, so for now we will leave it to you to decide whether to bring in a third party system for the purpose of the test.

Please note that this means we don't currently provide the icons shown in the designs. If you choose to pull in an external librarry, feel free to use icons from there. Equally a simple placeholder will also be sufficient.

## Getting started

To help you get up & running, we've included a fresh setup of create-react-app. In case you've not used it before, the docs can be found in the [README](CREATE-REACT-APP-README.md), and on their [documentation site](https://create-react-app.dev/).

You can start the app with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Navigation data

We have included an example navigation data JSON response in the data directory in this repo for you to pull in/mock how you wish. The response is also available to work against on a mock endpoint, with an artificial 1 second delay: https://run.mocky.io/v3/8ef098ca-8b25-42fb-8c8f-376b31bd9b28?mocky-delay=1000ms
